# features that I have added or implemented

## backlinks (WIP)
a kind-of implementation of backlinks is in [`_layout/page.html`](https://github.com/Joshua-Wright/wiki/blob/master/_layouts/page.html). It looks for wikilinks (links like `[[this]]`) in markdown or html.

This implementation is very hacky. I don't think there's a good way of actually doing this with the standard github-pages jekyll config, I think it's worth setting up a CI-server and using a plugin or something to make backlinks automatically (such as maybe this one: https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll )

Another problem with doing it this way is that every page must search through the content of every other page to look for links.
(so that's $O(n^2)$ on the number of pages, right?)
This would probably be a big problem if I had a significant number of pages. So, good luck with that, future-Josh.



## list of all pages
I can do this with a [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template:
```liquid
{% raw %}
{% for page in site.pages %}
{%- if page.published != false and page.title != nil -%}
* [[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url }})]
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

## turn raw urls into links automatically
enable `autolink` extension in `_config.yml` (ref https://github.com/github/jekyll-commonmark-ghpages)


## generate and serve the site locally
1. install ruby
2. add `Gemfile`:
  ```ruby
  source 'https://rubygems.org'
  gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins
  ```
3. `bundle install`
4. run it like:
  ```bash
  bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
  ```
5. optional: automate it with a `justfile`
  ```
  localhost:
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
  ```
